By descending priority:
* (requires help) deal with too restrictive rules regarding excluded nouns, e.g. interjection (like miércoles, oh etc.)
* (requires help) deal with more complex plural word formations like lesión/lesiones
* use more complete dictionary, e.g. http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/freeling/index.php/node/12
  mentions 555,000 forms ("76.000 lemma-PoS combinations") (is this WordNet 3.0 as ILI?)
  e.g. insistencia is missing

Nice to have:
* show editor for resolving ambiguous nouns
* add feedback form resp. ask to create issue in github (later requires github account which is a burden)
